On the backend, I leveraged technologies such as Node.js, GraphQL, NestJS, and Prisma to build a full-stack internal platform that now serves over 200 employees. Moreover, by working with Flutter, I enhanced my mobile development abilities and worked with cross-platform support by writing native Android (Kotlin) and iOS (Swift) code.",
