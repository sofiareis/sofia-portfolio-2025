          CareerCue&apos;s purpose came from recognizing the challenges and
          anxiety many prospective applicants face when preparing for job
          interviews. The entire process can be stressful, and many people
          don&apos;t have the resources to know how to best prepare for the
          questions that may be asked.

          CareerCue is made for anyone who is looking to improve or polish their
          interview skills, including beginners entering the workforce for the
          first time, underprivileged demographics who have limited access to
          career resources, mothers looking to return to their careers after
          maternity leave, or people who are trying to improve their
          communication skills.

        ChessMate is a one player chess engine where the user plays against an
        AI opponent. Not only can the player play a game of chess, they can save
        their games to replay for analysis and pause games in the middle of
        playing. The majority of the processing is done on the ARM chip on the
        DE1-SoC with rendering and move input being done on an Android phone.
        The DE1 and the phone are supposed to communicate over Bluetooth. This
        project aims to attract tech savvy people who are interested in learning
        how to play chess or improve their existing skill. Our design takes into
        consideration that not everyone has a pre-existing knowledge of chess,
        therefore it will perform move validation and automatically prevent
        illegal moves from being played.{" "}

        Triage is a crucial tool in managing long waitlists as the process
        enables more equitable care and allows patients with the greatest and
        most urgent needs to be seen first. However, it can be complicated, as
        referrals received by specialist physicians often differ in detail and
        length. The goal of PatientViz is to help physicians with the triage
        process and minimize long waiting lists.

          As an avid collector of the One Piece Card Game, I searched for a tool
          to manage my collection. However, existing card trackers either lacked
          certain features I wanted or didn&apos;t have a One Piece Card
          database.

          This project was born out of the desire to create a product that
          included all the requirements of a great tracker. One of the key
          motivations behind this project was the absence of a dedicated
          &quot;missing card&quot; feature in other trackers. I wanted a tool
          that not only helped me catalog my existing collection but also showed
          me exactly which cards I didn&apos;t have.
